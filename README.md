# Biorhythm Calculator

This example is part of the Ionic React course by Mirko Nasato.

This is an excellent course to learn about Ionic React Capacitor to develop PWA, iOS and Android apps from one HTML/CSS/JS codebase.

https://www.udemy.com/course/ionic-react/ sales twice a month and should be around \$15USD

In this repo I am developing the starter app as a PWA and creating an Android App to deploy to Google Play.

Added service-worker.js and registered as per CRA specs.
